# Max Flow and Min Cut Implementation

# Understanding Edges and Neighbors in the Methods

## **Edges in the Graph**
- **Definition**: In a graph, an edge represents a connection or a pathway between two nodes (`u` and `v`).
- **Role in the Methods**:
  - **`max_flow_lp`**:
    - Each edge `(u, v)` in the graph is associated with a flow variable (`flow_{u}_{v}`), which represents the amount of flow passing through that edge.
    - The capacities dictionary defines the maximum amount of flow each edge can handle.
    - The solver calculates how much flow should pass through each edge to maximize the overall flow from the `source` to the `target`.

  - **`find_min_cut`**:
    - Edges are used to construct a **residual graph**, which reflects the remaining capacities and possible flow reversals after solving for maximum flow.
    - The method identifies edges that form the minimum cut by analyzing the reachable nodes in the residual graph.

## **Neighbors in the Graph**
- **Definition**: A neighbor of a node is another node connected to it by an edge.
- **Role in the Methods**:
  - **`max_flow_lp`**:
    - When defining the objective function, neighbors of the `source` node are identified using:
      ```python
      set(v for u, v in graph if u == source)
      ```
      This ensures the total outgoing flow from the `source` node to its neighbors is maximized.
    - For flow conservation constraints, neighbors are used to calculate the inflow and outflow for each node:
      - **Inflow**: Sum of flows into the node from all its neighbors.
      - **Outflow**: Sum of flows out of the node to all its neighbors.

  - **`find_min_cut`**:
    - Neighbors play a critical role in the traversal of the **residual graph**:
      - Starting from the `source`, neighbors of each node are explored to find all reachable nodes using Depth-First Search (DFS).
      - This traversal identifies which nodes are accessible from the `source` in the residual graph and determines the edges that form the **minimum cut**.

## **Key Functions Using Edges and Neighbors**
1. **Objective Function in `max_flow_lp`**:
   - The flow out of the `source` is calculated by summing the flow variables for all its neighbors:
     ```python
     sum(flow_vars[(source, v)] for v in set(v for u, v in graph if u == source))
     ```

2. **Flow Conservation in `max_flow_lp`**:
   - For each node, the inflow (sum of incoming flows) is calculated using:
     ```python
     sum(flow_vars[(u, node)] for u, v in graph if (u, node) in flow_vars)
     ```
   - Similarly, the outflow (sum of outgoing flows) is calculated using:
     ```python
     sum(flow_vars[(node, v)] for u, v in graph if (node, v) in flow_vars)
     ```

3. **Residual Graph in `find_min_cut`**:
   - Neighbors are stored in an adjacency list format to represent possible paths:
     ```python
     residual_graph.setdefault(u, []).append(v)
     ```

4. **DFS for Reachable Nodes in `find_min_cut`**:
   - Neighbors are explored during the traversal of the residual graph:
     ```python
     for neighbor in residual_graph.get(node, []):
         if neighbor not in reachable:
             stack.append(neighbor)
     ```

5. **Identifying Minimum Cut Edges in `find_min_cut`**:
   - An edge `(u, v)` is part of the minimum cut if:
     - `u` is reachable from the `source`, but `v` is not:
       ```python
       if u in reachable and v not in reachable:
           min_cut.append((u, v))
       ```

---

## **Summary**
- **Edges** define the pathways in the graph and are associated with flow capacities.
- **Neighbors** of a node represent its direct connections and are used to:
  - Maximize flow in the `max_flow_lp` method.
  - Traverse the residual graph and identify the minimum cut in the `find_min_cut` method.
- These concepts are fundamental for solving the maximum flow and minimum cut problems efficiently.
